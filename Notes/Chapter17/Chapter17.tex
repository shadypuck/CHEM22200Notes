\chapter{Carboxylic Acids and Derivatives}
\section{Carboxylic Acids and Derivatives 1}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{4/7:}We now consider compounds that have heteroatoms where the $\alpha$ carbon of the carbonyl used to be.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The heteroatoms can be oxygen (esters), nitrogen, etc.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Today, we will do oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles but in this context.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Next Tuesday, we will do carbon and hydrogen nucleophiles in this context.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Carboxylic acid derivatives.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Once again, we will not be tested on nomenclature, but it's good to know.
        \item Acid anhydrides are so named because it is two carboxylic acids, minus a water molecule.
        \item Nitriles are still a carbon bonded to three heteroatoms; it's just the same heteroatom.
    \end{itemize}
    \item A key property of carboxylic acids is that they're\dots acidic.
    \item Acidity.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Gives the $\pKa$'s of benzoic acid, benzyl alcohol, and phenol to demonstrate that resonance is king in determining acidity.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Benzoic acid is more acidic than phenol, which is more acidic than benzyl alcohol.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Inductive effects (changes to the $\alpha$ carbon) play a smaller role.
        \item EWGs on arene rings when present play an even smaller role.
        \item These latter two effects allow us to fine-tune acidity.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Methods of carboxylic acid synthesis.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Overoxidation.
        \item Carboxylation of Grignards or lithiates.
        \item Nitrile hydrolysis.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Overoxidation.
    \item General form.
    \begin{equation*}
        \ce{CRH(OH) ->[CrO3, H2SO4][H2O] RCOOH}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Note that the reagents constitute Jones reagent.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Mechanism.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Virtually identical to that from \textcite{bib:CHEM22100Notes}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Carboxyliation of Grignards and lithiates.
    \item General form.

        \ce{RLi ->[1. CO2][2. H3O+] RCOOH}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item This mode of reactivity is the one that is most typical of carboxylic acid derivatives.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It is so-named because the portion of a carboxylic acid derivative that is not the leaving group is called an acyl group, and we are substituting one group on the acyl for another.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Think of all of the carboxylic acid derivatives (see Figure \ref{fig:carboxylicAcidDerivatives}) as containing a leaving group on one of their sides.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item When these compounds react nucleophiles, the nucleophile replaces the leaving group.
        \end{itemize}
        \item These reactions are either acid- or base-catalyzed.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In the acid-catalyzed version (Figure \ref{fig:acidCarboxylica}), the first step proceeds exactly as in Figure \ref{fig:acidPromotedNua}, except that $\ce{R$'$}=\ce{LG}$. The second step proceeds exactly as in Figure \ref{fig:acidPromotedNub}, except that it is the leaving group that is protonated and kicked out instead of the nucleophile we just added in.
            \item The basic mechanism is related to Figure \ref{fig:basePromotedNu}, but rather than being a straight replication, the alkoxide species produced in Figure \ref{fig:basePromotedNua} proceeds straight to the reactivity of the alkoxide in Figure \ref{fig:basePromotedNub} (see Figure \ref{fig:acidCarboxylicb}).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Tetrahedral intermediates}: The nucleophilic acyl substitution intermediates (of both the acidic and basic pathways) that have four groups attached to the central carbon.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Historically, the name arose when scientists were arguing about whether or not an $sp^3$ carbon could be in this reaction. Some scientists supported the theory that these tetrahedral intermediates existed, while others disagreed.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Nitrile hydrolysis.
    \item General form.
    \begin{equation*}
        \ce{RCN + H3O+ -> RCOOH + NH4+}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Note that here we're using a stoichiometric full equivalent of acid, not just catalytic acid, because we are liberating ammonia which mops up our acid, forming \ce{NH4+} as a byproduct.
        \item The existence of this reaction is the reason we consider nitriles to be carboxylic acid derivatives (i.e., because we can interconvert them with carboxylic acids). 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Mechanism.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Note that the fourth intermediate is one deprotonation away from being an amide.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item However, the reaction conditions do not produce an amide but continue as drawn to a carboxylic acid.
            \item This is because in general, the amide oxygen is more basic than the nitrile nitrogen, so if the conditions are such that the nitrile will begin the reaction, the amide will certainly finish it.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Note that there are some enzymes that can stop at the amide through various mechanisms that recognize one species as substrate but not another.
        \item Every once in a while, people will claim that they've isolated the amide in this mechanism, but these results are hard to reproduce because of the above facts.
        \item If we do add up all of the equivalents of water and acid added, we can see that only one equivalent of acid is added, overall (and two equivalents of water).

        \item Reagents is either \ce{SOCl2} or \ce{POCl3}.
        \item \ce{SOCl2} and \ce{POCl3} are \textbf{dehydrating agents}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dehydrating agent}: A chemical that drives conversions in which water is lost from a molecule.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Notice how the amide overall loses two hydrogens and an oxygen (i.e., a water molecule overall) in Figure \ref{fig:mechanismAmideDehydration}.

        \item Driving force: Kicking out a gas (\ce{SO2}) and chloride.
        \item Note that the mechanism implies that we must have an amide with two \ce{H}'s (esp., we cannot have one or two \ce{R} groups in their place).
        \item Although only the mechanism for \ce{SOCl2} is illustrated, the mechanism is virtually identical for \ce{POCl3}.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Both carboxylation and nitrile hydrolysis achieve the same end result from the same starting material, begging the question of why both are necessary.
        \item The answer lies in the fact that both suit different types of reaction conditions.
        \item Carboxylation is strongly basic, so we can't use molecules with free \ce{H}'s.
        \item Nitrile hydrolysis proceeds through S\textsubscript{N}2 to start, so we can't use tertiary bromides.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item We deprotonate the carboxylic acid using a relatively weak base.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \ce{K2CO3} is often the weak base of choice because it's insoluble in most solvents but will react in a biphasic mixture.
            \item Additionally, since \ce{KHCO3} is usually insoluble and the carboxylate is typically soluble in the organic solvent in which the reaction is being carried out, it's really easy to separate the two.
        \end{itemize}
        \item The second step proceeds via an S\textsubscript{N}2 mechanism, so methyl or primary alkyl halides are best.
        \item Note that the two initial oxygens (green) proceed through the whole of the process and end up in the product.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The acid is a catalyst, and we need an excess of the alcohol, which we typically just use as our solvent.
        \item Reasons we need an excess of the alcohol.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This is essentially a thermoneutral reaction; there's not a great thermodynamic driving force between the carboxylic acid and ester.
            \item Thus, the only way to get the reaction to go forward is to overwhelm it with an excess of the alcohol so that Le Ch\^{a}telier's principle comes into play.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Removing water can also help drive the reaction.
        \item \ce{H3O+} (i.e., excess water) reverses the reaction.
        \item Note that the mechanism here is a nucleophilic attack, and it is the \emph{methanol} oxygen (blue) that gets incorporated into the final ester (whose initial oxygens are colored green).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Saponification}: Subjecting an ester to a single equivalent of \ce{KOH} (or any other hydroxide base) to form the carboxylate and the alcohol.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is very old chemistry.
        \item Sapon- is the Latin prefix for soap.
        \item Ancient peoples discovered that combining and heating animal fat, wood ash, and a bit of water creates soap.
        \item Combining triglycerides with pot ash yields glycerol soap and long-chain fatty acid carboxylates.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Pot ash is where we get the name for potassium, because the ashes from a wood stove are rich in potassium hydroxide.
            \item Fatty acid carboxylates serve to solublize grease in water because the lipid end interacts with the grease and the carboxylate end interacts with the water. This is how all soaps work!
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item General form.
    \begin{equation*}
        \ce{RCOOR$'$ ->[KOH] RCOOK + R$'$OH}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The carboxylate is an end-stage product. Resonance delocalizes the negative charge over the carbon atom, significantly decreasing its electrophilicity and hence its capacity to participate in future reactions.
        \item The presence of basic conditions make it so that this reaction is not reversible. Indeed, if we mix a base with \ce{RCOOH}, we will just deprotonate the acid and return to the carboxylate form.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Mechanism.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Hydroxide attacks the ester as a nucleophile, and \ce{OR-} leaves to form a carboxylic acid. But \ce{OR-} (a strong base) will then deprotonate \ce{RCOOH} (a strong acid) to form the carboxylate and alcohol.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Acid chloride synthesis.
    \item General form.
    \begin{equation*}
        \ce{RCOOH ->[SOCl2][Py] RCOCl + [PyH]Cl + SO2}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Pyridine is not strictly necessary, but it greatly increases the reaction rate.
        \item Driven in a similar way to the dehydration of amides; we release \ce{SO2} gas, expel a water molecule, and mop up the extra \ce{Cl-} with pyridine.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Mechanism.

        \item Note that as in other mechanisms, DCC eventually transforms into a type of leaving group.
        \item Normally, we use external reagents for proton transfers because doing an internal one would in most cases involve a transition state with a 4-membered ring, which is highly strained.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item However, in step 5 here, we can do an internal proton transfer because the transition state's conformation is that of a 6-membered ring.

    \item Reactivity scale.
    \begin{equation*}
        \text{acid chloride} > \text{anhydride}
        > \text{ester}
        > \text{amide}
        > \text{carboxylate}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It should make intuitive sense that acid chlorides are the most reactive carboxylic acid derivatives and carboxylates are the least.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Acid chlorides have an electronegative group on the already electrophilic carbon, exacerbating the molecular dipole.
            \item Carboxylates delocalize their negative charge over the carbon (as discussed earlier), greatly reducing or eliminating the molecular dipole.
            \item A good rule of thumb is that the compound with the best leaving group and worst nucleophile (an acid chloride) is the most reactive, and vice versa in that the compound with the worst leaving group and the best nucleophile (a carboxylate) is the most reactive.
        \end{itemize}
        \item What we mean by "reactivity" is that compounds higher on the reactive scale can react with an appropriate nucleophile to become compounds lower on the scale.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For instance, we can take an acid chloride to an anhydride, ester, amide, or carboxylate (and we have reactions to do that), but we cannot take all (or any) of these molecules back to an acid chloride without forcing conditions.
            \item Some things that qualify as forcing conditions are the use of acidic conditions and dehydrating reagents.
            \item In other words, this reactivity scale is for the compounds in basic media with no dehydrating reagents present.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item MCAT comments.
    \item Trialkyl amines and pyridines.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item According to our reactivity scale, we should be able to react \ce{NEt3} with \ce{RCOCl} to yield an amine, for example.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item However, this leads to a positively charged nitrogen in the amine that cannot be quenched (e.g., by deprotonation). Thus, this is a highly reversible reaction that favors the reactants.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Similarly, we should be able to react an anhydride with pyridine.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item But since pyridine cannot be deprotonated either, the reactants are favored in this reversible reaction once again.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item However, this implies that pyridines can be used to catalyze nucleophilic acyl substitutions.
    \item \textbf{DMAP}: Dimethylaminopyridine, which is one of the best catalysts for nucleophilic acyl substitutions. \emph{Structure}

        \label{fig:DMAP}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Levin gives an example synthesis using DMAP, namely nucleophilic addition to an anhydride.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In essence, DMAP adds to the carbonyl, kicks out the leaving group, and then the nucleophile adds to the carbonyl and kicks out DMAP.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Adding DMAP can accelerate a reaction that would take overnight to taking only a few minutes.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Acid chlorides, anhydrides, and esters all create the same product (an amide) when reacting with an amine.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item But, you need only one equivalent of the amine for esters while you need two equivalents for the first two.
        \item This is because of the $\pKa$'s.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In order of increasing $\pKa$, we have $\ce{HCl}<\ce{RCOOH}<\ce{NR2H2+}<\ce{ROH}$.
            \item Thus, the first two byproducts (\ce{HCl} and \ce{RCOOH}) protonate amines in solution, whereas \ce{ROH} does not.

    \item Carboxylic acids.

        \ce{RCOOH ->[R$'$Li] RCOOLi + R$'$H}

    \end{equation*}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Two equivalents of the lithiate add in, the \ce{OR$'$} group leaves, and the alcohol is reduced.
        \item See Figure 9.2 of \textcite{bib:CHEM22100Notes} for the mechanism.
        \item The fact that we observe double addition means that the \textbf{overaddition product} is the major product. 
        \item If you only add one equivalent of lithiate, the major products will be the overaddition product and unreacted ester; the ketone will only be a very minor product.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This is because esters are less electrophilic due to donation from the ether oxygen, so the lithiate will selectively go for the ketone as soon as it becomes available.
            \item Ester resonance essentially partially protects it from nucleophilic addition.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Overaddition product}: A nucleophilic addition product in which the nucleophile adds more than once.

        \item See Figure 9.2 of \textcite{bib:CHEM22100Notes} for the mechanism.
        \item Mechanistically, the aldehyde intermediate is much more reactive than the ester, once again.
        \item Is it the lithium cation that bonds to the alkoxide or the \ce{AlH3} species?
    \end{itemize}
    \item Selecting for addition to the ester instead of addition to the aldehyde intermediate.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We are going to change the structure of our reducing agent.
        \item We want to continue using aluminum since \ce{NaBH4} is not strong enough, but we can play with the ligands.
        \item Thus, we change from the tetracoordinate \ce{AlH4-} to \textbf{DIBAL-H}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DIBAL-H}: Diisobutylaluminum hydride, a neutral, tricoordinate aluminum species with an empty $p$ orbital that is useful for selecting the mono-hydride addition product in cases where overaddition is common. \emph{Also known as} \textbf{DIBAL}. \emph{Structure}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item We might commonly expect to see the second intermediate (the zwitterion) decompose back into the initial reactants. However, it reacts to form a charge-neutral species that will not dissociate, as doing so would create an aluminum cation (highly unstable) in addition to the alkoxide.
        \item Aluminum's empty $p$ orbital plays a key role in the third step as a Lewis acid/electron acceptor for the electrons of the ether oxygen.
        \item The chelate is extra stable.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Even though there are only four atoms in its ring (as opposed to five or six), aluminum is a \emph{third}-row main group element, meaning that it forms longer, more flexible bonds. Thus, aluminum-containing rings can tolerate smaller number of atoms than normal organic ring systems.
            \item The implication is that it will not break down to kick out the alkoxide \ce{OR$'$-}. This stability is what most directly favors the monoaddition product.
        \end{itemize}
        \item The last several steps (after the addition of the acid) constitute the decomposition of a hemiacetal under acidic conditions.
        \item In practice, this reaction is really difficult to pull off.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The chelate is only stable at \SI{-78}{\celsius}. If it warms up much beyond that, it will decompose into the aldehyde.
            \item The reaction of DIBAL-H with the ester is exothermic, so you have to keep it really cold and do the addition really slowly. Otherwise, the internal exotherm will raise the temperature and ruin the reaction.
            \item Thus, you will often see in the literature chemists circumventing this reaction via a reduction (\ce{LiAlH4 + H3O+}) followed by PCC/Swern.
            \item However, for the purposes of this class, we can treat the DIBAL-H method as if it works perfectly in every case, i.e., as if we're just laying out a synthetic plan and the person performing the reactions will do everything perfectly. In other words, we should definitely feel free to use this method (as written from a na\"{i}ve perspective) in any synthesis questions we encounter.

            \item Unlike with esters, there is no good leaving group in the first intermediate.
            \item Indeed, adding another lithiate would kick out an \ce{N^2-} species (highly unstable), but this would never happen.
            \item Additionally, since the acid destroys the \ce{LiAlH4}, even though we end up producing a ketone (an electrophilic carbonyl), there is no further reactivity.
        \end{itemize}
        \item The last step is imine hydrolysis, which Levin mentioned in Lecture 2 is reactivity to which imines are prone.

        \item As in Figure \ref{fig:mechanismEsterDIBAL}, the heteroatom (nitrogen) attacks the aluminum of DIBAL-H to start. We then undergo the same proton rearrangement to get to a stable species. However, instead of forming a chelate, the acid takes us to the same imine as in Figure \ref{fig:mechanismNitrileAlkylation}, and then further to the aldehyde (also as in Figure \ref{fig:mechanismNitrileAlkylation}).

    \begin{itemize}
        \item From an alkyl halide precursor, use \ce{KCN} to take it to a nitrile, and then transform it to your carboxylic acid derivative of choice.
        \item From a ketone, use \ce{HCN} to take it to a cyanohydrin, and then move to a carboxylic acid derivative.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Watch out for acidic protons on the alcohol here, though!
            \item Because of it, we can reduce to an amine with \ce{LiAlH4} with ease, but we have to play with the concentrations to get the others to work (for example, by using a huge excess of the reagent in comparison to a lithiate).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Transforming carboxylates to ketones.
    \item General form.
    \begin{equation*}
        \ce{RCOOH ->[1. R$'$Li, \Delta][2. H3O+, time] CORR$'$}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Grignards won't work here; we do need the stronger lithiates.
        \item We need an excess of \ce{R$'$Li} and high heat ($\sim\SI{100}{\celsius}$).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Mechanism.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The excess lithiate is used to both deprotonate the carboxylic acid and alkylate the carboxylate that gets formed.
        \item The heat is used to overcome the low electrophilicity of the carboxylate.
    \end{itemize}
